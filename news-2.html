            <p>So, you’ve done the hard work of <u>choosing the best formula for your baby</u> (bravo!)…but that was just the first step in your feeding journey. And now, you’re probably finding that your laundry list of feeding questions continues to grow: Now that you’ve brought those formula canisters home, where do you put them? How do you mix infant formula? Maybe your baby chugged 3 ounces of formula, but left an ounce in the bottle. Should you save it for later?</p>
            <p>It’s a lot to digest! That’s why we’re here to guide you through all of your questions about storing and preparing baby formula…in a way that goes down easy.</p>

            <h2 class="header-news-1">Different Types of Baby Formula</h2>
            <p class="classify"><i>Before we start throwing around “formula” we should define what we’re talking about. Formula is no monolith! Baby formula comes in three different forms—and each type has its own storage and preparation guidelines. The three types of infant formula are: powdered, concentrate, and ready-to-use. Here’s the scoop on each one…</i></p>
        <div class="form-news">
            <p><b>Powdered formula:</b> This is the most common and most inexpensive type of baby formula. It comes with a pre-measured scoop you can use to mix the powder with water easily and safely.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="form-news">
            <p><b>Concentrate formula:</b>  This infant formula comes in liquid form—but it’s not ready to drink. Instead, you mix it with equal parts water. It tends to cost more than powdered baby formula.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="form-news">
          <p><b>Ready-to-use formula:</b>  Sometimes referred to as RTU baby formula, this is the priciest of the bunch because it’s ready for your baby to drink as is. It often comes in multiple packs starting at two ounces per bottle.</p>
        </div>
            <p class="classify"><i>How to Store Baby Formula</i></p>
        <div class="form-news">
            <p>Whether opened or not—pre-mixed or powdered—where and how you store your baby formula matters! Here’s how to do it safely. </p>        
        </div>
            <p class="header-news-1"><b>Where do I store unopened baby formula?</b></p>
        <div class="form-news">
            <p>Store cans of powdered and concentrated formula in a cool, dry area. That means not in the refrigerator and away from a heat source, which includes a hot car. </p>
            <p>Close contact with heat can weaken the nutrient content of your baby formula. Like powdered baby formula, ready-to-use and concentrated liquid infant formula should be stored in a cool, dry place before being opened.  </p>
        </div>
        <p class="classify"><i>How do you make baby formula for preemies?</i></p>
        <div class="form-news">
            <p>If your baby was born prematurely or has a weakened immune system, it’s a good idea to contact your baby’s pediatrician to find out if you need to take any extra precautions in preparing your little one’s formula. In some cases, ready-to-use formula will be advised over powdered formula. Other times, your child’s pediatrician may suggest you boil the water used with formula to kill any microbes. (Boil water, let it cool for about 5 minutes, add to a clean bottle, then add the powdered formula. Make sure the baby formula is at body temperature before feeding.)</p>
